This study explores the use of ensemble learning for plant disease detection by combining multiple transfer-learned CNN models on the PlantDoc leaf image dataset through SoftMax Averaging. The ensemble approach proved more effective than individual models, showing better robustness when handling complex agricultural images under varied real-world conditions. Our findings suggest that leveraging diverse pretrained architectures can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy for challenging plant disease identification Our work demonstrates a pathway for earlier and more accurate leukemia diagnosis to support better patient treatment outcomes.
