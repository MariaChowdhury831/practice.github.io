This study examines automated leukemia subtype detection from blood smear images through transfer learning with CNN models like DenseNet201, EfficientNetB6, and Xception, reaching 99.69% accuracy, while also comparing traditional feature extraction techniques including Hu Moments and Haralick Texture paired with various classifiers. Our results show deep learning substantially outperforms conventional methods, providing a pathway for more accurate and earlier leukemia diagnosis to improve patient treatment outcomes.
