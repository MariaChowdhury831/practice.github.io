excerpt: "This study examines automated leukemia subtype detection from blood smear images through transfer learning with CNN models like DenseNet201, EfficientNetB6, and Xception, reaching 99.69% accuracy. We also evaluated traditional feature extraction methods, including Hu Moments and Haralick Texture, paired with various classifiers. Our work demonstrates a pathway for earlier and more accurate leukemia diagnosis to support better patient treatment outcomes."
